# Day and Night Theme

Hello! This is a tutorial for how to achieve the macOS theme from [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/o7uy6m/rectanglemacos_day_and_night_first_rice/).

## Programs and Dependencies
This is a list of programs that will be needed.

Terminal:

* [iterm2](https://iterm2.com/)
* [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/)
* [oh-my-zh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) (theme: robbyrussell)


Window manager:
* [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/)

Themes:
* [pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal)

   ``Day theme: wal -n -i /path/to/daypicture``

   ``Night theme: wal --theme dkeg-vans``

vscode pywal extension:
* [vscode wal theme](https://github.com/dlasagno/vscode-wal-theme) (i'm pretty sure it automatically syncs with pywal)

Apple's docs on launchd:
* [launchd](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/Chapters/CreatingLaunchdJobs.html) (i'll post my plists to automate the theme switching)

Dynamic Wallpaper Generator:
* [dynamic wallpaper creator](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dynamic-wallpaper-maker/id1453846328?mt=12) (it syncs with ur location to find dusk and dawn and you could set the pictures for almost every few hours).
